## Sunset of backend.run interface

The [`backend.run`](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.IBMBackend#run)
interface in Qiskit Runtime is now deprecated and will be removed from the
`qiskit-ibm-runtime` package on the 15th of October. IBM's API will stop
accepting jobs submitted through this interface at the same time.

<Admonition type="caution" title="Action needed">

To avoid disruption, [migrate your
projects](/api/migration-guides/qiskit-runtime) to
V2 primitives before the 15th of October 2024. Jobs submitted through the
`backend.run` interface after this time will be rejected.

</ Admonition>

See the [official announcement](/announcements/product-updates/2024-04-15-backend-run-deprecation).

## Qiskit 1.3 will drop Python 3.8 support

Qiskit 1.3.0 will be the first release after Python 3.8 reaches its end-of-life
stage and stops being supported. Qiskit version 1.3.0 and later may use
features only available in Python 3.9. To use these later versions of Qiskit,
you'll need to upgrade the version of Python you're using to 3.9 or greater.

See this announcement in the [release notes](/api/qiskit/release-notes/1.1#deprecation-notes)

##  Qiskit adds typed classical variables to quantum circuits

Qiskit [`QuantumCircuit`](/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit) objects
can now contain typed classical variables for real-time classical computation.
Use this feature to do classical calulations based on results of qubit
measurements.

```python
from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit, ClassicalRegister, QuantumRegister
from qiskit.circuit.classical import expr, types
 
qr = QuantumRegister(2, "q")
cr = ClassicalRegister(2, "c")
qc = QuantumCircuit(qr, cr)
# Add two input variables to the circuit with different types.
a = qc.add_input("a", types.Bool())
mask = qc.add_input("mask", types.Uint(2))
 
# Test whether the input variable was true at runtime.
with qc.if_test(a) as else_:
    qc.x(0)
with else_:
    qc.h(0)
 
qc.cx(0, 1)
qc.measure(qr, cr)
 
# Add a typed variable manually, initialized to the same value as the classical register.
b = qc.add_var("b", expr.lift(cr))
 
qc.reset([0, 1])
qc.h(0)
qc.cx(0, 1)
qc.measure(qr, cr)
 
# Store some calculated value into the `b` variable.
qc.store(b, expr.bit_and(b, cr))
# Test whether we had equality, up to a mask.
with qc.if_test(expr.equal(expr.bit_and(b, mask), mask)):
    qc.x(0)
```
