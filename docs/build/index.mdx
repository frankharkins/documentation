# Introduction

Meaningless change.

In the build phase, you create quantum programs that represent the problem you are solving. The foundation of quantum programs are quantum circuits, which consist of operations - including gates, measurement, and reset - that manipulate qubits in the quantum computer.  Depending on your needs, you can use the Qiskit SDK or OpenQASM to create your circuits. 

All tasks require building one or more [quantum circuits](circuit-construction). Some tasks additionally require constructing [quantum operators](operators-overview) to define properties of quantum states that you want to estimate or measure.

Qiskit enables working with circuits (and, to some extent, operators) at various abstraction levels: abstract, virtual, physical, scheduled, and pulse programs. At the most abstract level is a task-oriented lens in the [circuit library](circuit-library). You can also express operations in abstract mathematical terms using operators, isometries, and classical/Boolean functions. For virtual circuits, mathematical abstractions take on a concrete representation in terms of a concrete gate set. At the physical level, those instructions are mapped to specific physical qubits, and instructions are re-written to reflect the connectivity and native gate set of a target hardware platform. Scheduled circuits introduce timing information, and [pulse programs](pulse) represent signals on channels.

Qiskit and [OpenQASM](introduction-to-qasm) further support the notion of extended circuits, which expand the set of allowed operations to include real-time computations on classical values. Qiskit's tooling for working with this richer family of circuits is found in the section on [Classical feedforward and control flow](classical-feedforward-and-control-flow).

## Next steps

<Admonition type="tip" title="Recommendations">
  -  Start building circuits by exploring the [Circuit library](circuit-library) topic.
  -  See an example of circuits being used in the [Grover's Algorithm](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/tutorial/grovers-algorithm) tutorial.
  -  Work with simple circuits in the [Explore gates and circuits with the Quantum Composer](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/tutorial/explore-gates-and-circuits-with-the-quantum-composer) tutorial.
